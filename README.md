# NgrxTodoApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.8.

This quick start begins with a working angular application that has CRUD operations for TODOs. This application uses Ngrx data and entity services to make CRUD operations.  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Web Api Server

Run `npm run server` to use web api (nodejs) from angular application.

## How it works?

- Clone the repository and run `npm install` to load dependencies.
- Run node server `npm run server` in a new termial.
- Run angular application `ng serve --open` in another terminal.
